================

GPS data converter for Recon Instruments MOD / Flight HUD files

Very beta RIB to GPX converter - and soon to be other things too.

Windows users:
First, copy .RIB files from HUD to your computer!
Then drag one or more of .RIB files onto Convert_Win.
.GPX files should appear where your .RIB files were.


Linux users:
(copy .RIB files from HUD first)
$ java -jar FlightConverter.jar *.RIB


Mac OS users:
Uhh.... I am not sure
Try... maybe... copy .RIB files from HUD somewhere,
then open a Terminal and type
java -jar FlightConverter.jar <file.RIB>
